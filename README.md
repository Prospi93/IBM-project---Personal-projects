# IBM-project---Personal-projects
In this section you can find my Jupyter Notebook projects, i download the datasets from Kaggle and i do data exploration, data wrangling, data visualization, dashboard, machine learning and other activities. I have a lot of fun exploring datasets and maybe not all the projects are serious works but they are a good training
